"""Package for isomorphisms in multilayer networks.

The package is based on reducing multilayer network isomorphism problems to graph isomorphism problems.
The graph isomorphism problems can be solved using different backends. Currently the following backends
are supported (the functions these backends can be used for are in parenthesis):

- NetworkX :  "nx" (is_isomorphic, get_isomorphism)
- PyBliss : "bliss" (is_isomorphic, get_isomorphism, get_automorphism_generators, get_complete_invariant)

    Parameters
    ----------
    net1 : MultilayerNetwork
       The first multilayer network.
    net2 : MultilayerNetwork
       The second multilayer network.
    allowed_aspects : list of ints, string
       The aspects that can be permuted in this isomorphism type. Nodes are in aspect 0 by convention.
       Value "all" will allow all permutations, i.e., it gives the (nonpartial) node-layer isomorphism.

    Returns
    -------
    complete_invariant : object
       The returned object is a complete invariant under the specified multilayer network isomorphism.
       That is, any two objects returned by this function are the same exactly when the two networks are
       isomorphic. Note that the isomorphism types (allowed_aspects) need to match in order for the comparison 
       to be valid. The actual object can depend on the backend that was used.
