Downloading and installing
==========================

You can download the latest source files directly from the repository https://github.com/bolozna/Multilayer-networks-library as a zip file. Alternatively,
you can use Git to clone the repository:

.. code-block:: none

   $ git clone git@github.com:bolozna/Multilayer-networks-library.git

The current version of the library is written purely in Python, and simply adding the library directory to your Python path is enough to start using it.
